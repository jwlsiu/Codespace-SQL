### 1. Querying Data AND Sorting Data ### 
Using the database called ‘hr’.
* **Activity 1:** Using locations select * attributes and display. Then use Select for three attributes including the primary key and display. Make sure to distinguish where the primary key is coming from in terms of the table name. e.g. tablename. attribute

* **Activity 2:** Create an sql that will show the employee_id, last name and their salary. Then use an alias for the table name – simply use the letter e to reference it. Instead of salary use the alias ‘Monthly Salary’ for the last attribute.

Determine the yearly salary assuming that the salary in the employee table is ‘Monthly salary’

Determine the years of service using the functions (DATEDIFF) and also (ROUND)

* **Activity 3:** On the select clause combine the persons first name with their name last to be shown as the alias called ‘Fullname’.

Use the ORDER BY clause to sort according to one of the attributes.

Sort according to two attributes, when not specifically mentioned next to the attributes it means an Ascending sort.

* **Activity 4:** Complete an sql that will display a person’s lastname, email, salary and have the sort done according to the person salary in descending order (so highest will be at the top), if two people have the same salary then the secondary sort should be lastname in ascending order.
